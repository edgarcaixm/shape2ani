	 * The Action interface must be implemented by all particle actions.
	 * 
	 * <p>An Action is a class that is used to continuously modify an aspect 
	 * of a particle by updating the particle every frame. Actions may, for 
	 * example, move the particle or modify its velocity.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>Actions are directly associated with emitters and act on all
	 * particles created or added to that emitter. Actions are applied to 
	 * all particles created by an emitter by using the emitter's addAction 
	 * method. Actions are removed from the emitter by using the emitter's
	 * removeAction method.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>The key method in the Action interface is the update method.
	 * This is called every frame, for every particle and is where the
	 * action modifies the particle's properties.</p>

		 * and need not be called by the user.
		 * 
		 * <p>Because the method is called for every particle, every frame it is
		 * a key area for optimization of the code. When creating a custom action
		 * it is usually worth making this method as efficient as possible.</p>
