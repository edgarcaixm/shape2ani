	 * The Initializer interface must be implemented by all particle initializers.
	 * 
	 * <p>An Initializer is a class that is used to set properties of a particle 
	 * when it is created. Initializers may, for example, set an initial velocity
	 * for a particle.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>Initializers are directly associated with emitters and act on all
	 * particles created by that emitter. Initializers are applied to 
	 * all particles created by an emitter by using the emitter's addInitializer 
	 * method. Initializers are removed from the emitter by using the emitter's
	 * removeInitializer method.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>The key method in the Initializer interface is the initiaize method.
	 * This is called for every particle and is where the initializer modifies 
	 * the particle's properties.</p>
