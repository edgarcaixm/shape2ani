	 * The PixelRenderer draws particles as single pixels on a Bitmap display object. The
	 * region of the particle system covered by this bitmap object is defined by the width
	 * and height of the renderer. Particles outside this region are not drawn.
	 * 
	 * <p>The PixelRenderer allows the use of BitmapFilters to modify the appearance
	 * of the bitmap. Every frame, under normal circumstances, the Bitmap used to
	 * display the particles is wiped clean before all the particles are redrawn.
	 * However, if one or more filters are added to the renderer, the filters are
	 * applied to the bitmap instead of wiping it clean. This enables various trail
	 * effects by using blur and other filters.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>The PixelRenderer has mouse events disabled for itself and any 
	 * display objects in its display list. To enable mouse events for the renderer
	 * or its children set the mouseEnabled or mouseChildren properties to true.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>This version of the PixelRenderer is a UIComponent and is intended for
	 * use in MXML documents.</p>
