	/**
	 * The F3DObjectClasses Initializer sets the class of the 3D Object to use 
	 * to draw the particle in a 3D scene. It selects one of multiple object 
	 * classes that are passed to it. It is used with the Flare3D renderer when
	 * particles should be represented by a 3D object.
	 * 
	 * <p>This class is actually just a copy of the ImageClasses initializer. It is included
	 * here to make it clear that this is one way to initialize a 3d particle's
	 * object for rendering in an Flare3d scene.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>If you need to set properties of the object class that are not accessible through
	 * the object constructor, you should use the SetImageProperties initializer to set
	 * these additional properties.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>In situations where all the particles are the same, or are one of a small number of
	 * objects, the F3DCloneObject and F3DCloneObjects initializers are more efficient
	 * because they use one set of geometry and material data for all the similar particles.
	 * This initializer creates new data for each particle.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>This class is useful where a custom object class produces visually different
	 * objects every time it is used.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>This class includes an object pool for reusing objects when particles die.</p>
