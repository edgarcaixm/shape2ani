	 * The Alt3DObjectClasses Initializer sets the class of the 3D Object to use 
	 * to draw the particle in a 3D scene. It selects one of multiple object 
	 * classes that are passed to it. It is used with the Alternativa3D renderer when
	 * particles should be represented by a 3D object.
	 * 
	 * <p>This class is actually just a copy of the ImageClasses initializer. It is included
	 * here to make it clear that this is one way to initialize a 3d particle's
	 * object for rendering in an Alternativa3d scene.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>If you need to set properties of the object class that are not accessible through
	 * the object constructor, you should use the SetImageProperties initializer to set
	 * these additional properties.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>This class includes an object pool for reusing objects when particles die.</p>
